            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun photographed my friend's wedding over the summer and not only produced a wonderful documentation of that event but found a way into our hearts that day.... I wish that I had hired him as my wedding photographer but I'm glad that he could perform such a wonderful service for my good friend.<div class="rev-writer">... Tanja</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">I highly recommend Varun to photograph your events.  He is very accommodating and can do portraits, as well as document the day, with candids and a handful of lovely more "artsy" shots.  He is very pleasant to deal with and was genuinely happy to be a part of our event.  He's a true professional and spent time editing the photos so they were "just right."  We are very pleased with Varun's work and would look forward to working with him again.....<div class="rev-writer">... Wendi</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">...He was prompt in sending me the images after the event and was even willing to do additional retouches a few of my favorites. He always had a smile on his face during the party, and make sure to capture every moment, as well as every guest that arrived.  I will definitely be calling Varun for future family events. He was wonderful to work with! I highly recommend Varun and his work!....<div class="rev-writer">... Chandni</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun was warm, kind and helpful. He got on with the job and did not seem to make many intrusions throughout the night. He was very quick getting back with the processed pics and there are a few that really impressed us. Great value... many thanks Varun!<div class="rev-writer">... Geoff B.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">My husband and I were recommended Trojan Photography for our wedding through mutual friends and we weren't disappointed! ...Our wedding photos turned out better than we ever expected. We were a bit nervous to make sure we got lasting photos, and Varun made us look amazing. We both have large families and we were able to get all the posed shots we wanted very quickly. Varun shines with the candid shots, though. Every time we look at our album we're transported back to that day. Overall, we wouldn't have chosen anyone else. Varun, thank you for capturing the best day of our lives!<div class="rev-writer">... Sarah P.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">We hired Varun for our Indian wedding. He is very nice and calm person. We loved his photography and specially i like his collection of lenses. We were very shy but he made us comfortable during photography. He suggested nice locations and did wonderful work. Our wedding location had not sufficient lights but he managed to take good pictures. Indian weddings are very long and he captured each and every moments. I definitely recommend him. Some of the pictures are so good that we will use them for greeting cards for Diwali Festivals. Thanks Varun and keep up the good work.<div class="rev-writer">... Tejas R.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">I am a wedding and event planner and had the pleasure of working with Varun at my client's wedding in Livermore, CA. As a planner, it can be challenging to work vendors you've never worked with before to ensure the flow of the wedding is exactly how it should be, but this was not the case with Varun and I have nothing but great things to say about him!! He was highly professional and extremely flexible when there were a few minor timeline changes. He was a delight to work with! With this being said, when I finally got the opportunity to view his work I was even more impressed. He was able to capture priceless moments for the bride and groom and I know they were also impressed with the outcome. I definitely plan on referring  my future clients to him. :)<div class="rev-writer">... Adriana V.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun was a great guy to work with. Absolutely the best at what he does! He provided his services for our wedding, he showed up on time and prepared for all shots. He is very attentive and has a keen eye for detail. Varun will definitely NOT disappoint. We wouldn't had great memories without his photographs. All photographs are professional, clearly reflects the kind of photographer he is. His communication is great,and his prices are great too! We would definitely recommend him to anyone who is looking for a great and professional photographer.<div class="rev-writer">... Hachi S.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Hiring Varun to shoot our wedding was a great decision.  We were looking for a wedding photographer a little last minute which was stressful. A lot of photographers had a minimum 4 hours coverage and that is not what we wanted. We were looking for 2 hours of coverage and  specific shots. Varun was very flexible with us and he was reasonably priced. Communication with him was great which eased my mind of finding someone on craigslist. ...He did a great job getting our large wedding party together  and working around our family members who were trying to shoot the wedding. He had some cool photo ideas that truly showed our personalities. He provided us with the retouched digital copies of all our photos in both b&w and color. Everyone was raving about our photos and that we had an awesome photographer. If you are looking for someone who provides quality photos and who is easy to work with go with Varun.<div class="rev-writer">... LaNiesha W.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">We hired (Trojan Shooter) Varun to capture in photographs the morning Bat Mitzvah ceremony and evening celebration for my daughter Kira and couldn't be happier with the results.  Varun was a true professional to work with, and was totally unobtrusive at the events, allowing the guests to fully enjoy themselves.  But he also somehow managed to really capture the whole emotion of the day through his photographs which definitely tell a story.  The posed pictures are always wonderful to have, and he got those as well, but my favorites are the little moments he caught, like the embrace my daughter gave her best friend when she arrived to the temple, Mom wiping her tears away while giving Kira her blessing, and Kira laughing while being raised up into the air at her celebration party or on the dance floor with her friends. Varun also took the time to do the final retouches to erase a wardrobe malfunction in several of the photos with excellent results.  I know I will love to look at these photos many times in the future and look forward to sharing them with relatives who weren't able to attend.  if you have an important event coming up I highly recommend you hire Varun to capture it.  You will not be disappointed.<div class="rev-writer">... Marla F.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Let me first say that Varun photographed our wedding on June 13, 2015...and I just couldn't be happier with everything.  He went waaaaay above and beyond any expectation that I had and the pictures were just exceptional. ...Varun was great from the beginning.  He was quick to respond to my questions, although I really didn't know what to ask him other then..."You'll be there..right?"  We meet up prior to officially signing on and I just knew from that moment that he just "got me".  He understood what I was saying and from the looks of my pictures, he truly listened to me. So now onto what I saw when Varun sent me the pictures he'd taken...and all I can say is...OMG!!! Words cannot express how happy I am with everything.  The pictures were amazing and incredible and beautiful and just above and beyond my expectations. I cannot thank him enough for capturing the most amazing day of my life.  And the close-ups of some of the decor was just incredible. I can't believe how he captured the tiniest detail.  Just beautiful.  <div class="rev-writer">... Anita R. </div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">We really appreciated Varun's effort and ability in putting together a very nice custom package that fit our special day.  We would highly recommend Varun to anyone looking for wedding photography or any other special occasion.<div class="rev-writer">... Cat X. </div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">We hired Varun to do our engagement pictures and we couldn't be happier with the result. We interviewed many photographers want to ensure that we have the best photographer that fits our budget. Not only the pictures come out great, Varun was super-fun to be around. The best part that I liked about his style was that he captured our true personality and mood. He was there to recommend some poses and styles but gladly, he wasn't too obsessed with minor details like keeping our fingers, chin, hand in a specific way like I've seen with some photographers and he made us feel very comfortable and natural during the shoot - and that's what made the pictures come so true to life.<div class="rev-writer">... Leslie C.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun photographed my parents' 50th Wedding Anniversary.  He was absolutely spectacular and professional in every way.  He was very communicative from the beginning and timely in all aspects.  His photographs were absolutely stunning and beautiful. He truly captures those special moments.  I felt that the pictures from the event really captured who we are as a family.  We could not have been happier.  He is one of the nicest guys I have had the pleasure of working with.  He fit right into the ceremony!  I would hire Varun for any future special event!<div class="rev-writer">... Minerva T.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">We worked with Varun on our wedding photos, everyone LOVED the photos and he captured a lot of planned shots but also a lot of action shots. It was so fun to sit down and look at the photos since as the bride and groom you're in such a rush that you cannot enjoy the moment. But looking at the photos and the beautifully captured angles and lighting, it's such an amazing feeling. Varun had the touched up files to us almost immediately and all the photos within one week, it's great because a lot of friends' photographers took so long to get them the photos that the moment and the excitement had passed! It's nice to review them while they're all fresh in your mind still. I would definitely recommend him, he's very prompt, kind and responsive that it made the wedding planning so much easier to know one item is 100% under control and in such great hands!<div class="rev-writer">... Shohreh M.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">This was the third big party of my life that we had Varun cover for us. And since I can now compare, this was the best experience I had. A++..Reached the venue before time. Excellent shots were taken. Very patient. The pictures were shared after the party in a timely manner. <div class="rev-writer">... Tanu G.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Couldn't have asked for a better photographer. We got in contact with Varun very early in our wedding planning process and he kept in touch with us as the date got closer. Definitely gave us peace of mind knowing he would show up prepared. One thing we enjoyed about his style is that he captures genuine moments. ... Varun caught some great moments that we are sure will bring back great memories.<div class="rev-writer">... Guerrero L.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Can't say enough good things about Varun. He's prompt, reliable, respectful, artistic, and knowledgable. We hired Varun to photograph our son's Bar Mitzvah. He was clear with his communication and was able to show great examples of his work. To be honest, I was a bit apprehensive given that I found him on Craigslist. But when I showed up the morning of the event, he was the first one there and was set up and ready to go before everyone else.Varun was a delight to have at the event as well and my guests felt very comfortable with him. He was dressed professionally and carried himself with an extremely professional demeanor as well. The pictures were fantastic. True to his word, he delivered the final retouched images within a few weeks. I'd highly recommend Varun and looking forward to having him back for my daughter's bat mitzvah in a few years. <div class="rev-writer">... Jeff K.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun is a professional that I will be using again for my future projects!!! After searching Craigslist and discovering that I was behind the power-curve on planning, I came across Trojan Shooter. His photos were on point and best of all he was available for the evening and was willing to drive to Union Square for us. During our correspondence prior to the evening, Varum was professional and maintained a calm demeanor. Imagine herding, 7 40 year olds, dressed as Elves and Christmas Themed Beauties, wine filled, out of the hotel on-time. His patience was just what we needed and he was flexible with all of our desires and offered some great ideas for backdrops. ...Call today and book your appointment with this talented individual.<div class="rev-writer">... Ralph C.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun was the photographer at our wedding a couple weeks ago. I found him on Craigslist and looked through his online portfolio, I liked what I saw! I contacted him and he responded very quickly. I was a little iffy hiring someone I found on Craigslist, but don't worry he is amazing! Varun is a very nice person and makes people feel very comfortable in front of the camera. We got the photos very quickly and they came out AMAZING! We have gotten so many compliments on how beautiful the photos are. I would HIGHLY recommend him!<div class="rev-writer">... Liz V.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">We first hired Varun for our first baby shower in 2013, that baby is now 2 years old and I called Varun for her 2nd birthday (we celebrated the first in India!) without thinking twice. He is professional, courteous, punctual and is a rather jolly guy with an undying smile end-2-end =). We liked his work and would definitely use his services again in future, highly recommended. He sticks to his time lines on out put and goes above and beyond in terms of service. Again very personable!<div class="rev-writer">... A K.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">We hired Varun for our wedding and loved working with him. We just wanted him for a short time, about 4 hours, but he definitely made the most of that time. He got beautiful shots of all of our friends and family, and was never obtrusive. He was also by far the best deal in town. Highly recommended!<div class="rev-writer">... Hannah S.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">I cannot begin to say enough great things about Varun. We originally found Varun through Craigslist and quickly read through his website and 5 star yelp reviews. ...On the actual day of the wedding, Varun showed up early and immediately began documenting the details of the wedding including the venue and decorations, which we had asked for. ...Throughout the ceremony and reception he seemed to be everywhere at once and this came across in the actual photos. The attention to detail in the photos of everyone getting ready was incredible. We actually saw things in the photos that we missed happening in real time. Throughout wedding planning process, Varun was extremely responsive and professional. He was without a doubt my favorite wedding vendor that we worked with. I highly recommend Varun for any photography needs, wedding or otherwise.<div class="rev-writer">... Johnathon F.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun was our wedding photographer and I was so grateful I hired him. First, he has excellent communication. Multiple calls before the wedding to discuss location, lighting, and the timeline for the ceremony. His price was very reasonable, and straight forward. I had spoken with several other photographers with complicated "packages" that felt like I was paying for services I didn't need. Varun was no nonsense. I really appreciated that. ...Last, the photos were great! I was so impressed by the quality of photos. He promptly met up with me with a disk of high res photos. We got electronic copies of all the photos--unlike other photographers where they have tricky contracts limiting you to only some copies. Everyone loved them and I'm sure to cherish my for time to come.<div class="rev-writer">... Heather C.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">I work for an international charity that teaches surgeons and medical teams to perform life-saving heart surgery on children born with congenital heart defects. Varun beautifully captured our 25th anniversary event through his photography. I have worked with a number of photographers and while many of them are talented, Varun stands out for these reasons: 1. He listens ...2. He was able to produce beautiful photos in tricky lighting ...3. He is passionate and creative ...I highly recommend Varun. He is a stand-out photographer!<div class="rev-writer">... Jenn M.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Worked with Varun recently for my daughter's first birthday party and would certainly be working with him again. Very professional and gently prompted us to pose for all the right moments. Would highly recommend his services for any memorable events that you might want to capture!<div class="rev-writer">... Ratika S.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">We debated getting a professional photographer for our small wedding in September in Santa Rosa. My fiancee and I weren't sure what to do. Selecting Varun to shoot it turned out to be one of the best decisions we made. ...Using a photographer can be stressing, but Varun was so nice. He has a relaxed air about him which made everyone comfortable. He had smart ideas about what kind of photos to take and did everything we wanted to do as well. And not only that, the pictures are wonderful! We are very pleased. Now we will have professional pictures to look back on for years. This is a great comfort. The candids are super as well; we have shared them with our friends and family. Our experience with Varun was fantastic--I'm sure yours will be too.<div class="rev-writer">... Matthew F.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun was such a pleasure to work with! I hired him for my wedding in May and he definitely went above and beyond to make sure the process was smooth and flawless. He has such a detailed and creative eye, that the photos are natural. I met with him a few months before the wedding to go over details, the vision and timeline. We kept in touch through email mainly, he answered every question. The day of, I was not worried or concerned, I enjoyed his approach, not so in your face as a lot of other wedding photographers can be (his approach fit our style). He had the digital proofs ready to go within a month. I would highly recommend him and wish him continuous growth in this profession.<div class="rev-writer">... Hudson A.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">We had planned to have our wedding onboard a cruise ship, but due to some strange international laws, we had to quickly change gears and get married at City Hall.  About 5 days before the wedding, I decided we needed to "capture the moment".  I had very grave doubts that I would be able to find a photographer, let alone a good one. I contacted Varun and he was able to accommodate us.  He arrived and we immediately felt at ease with him.  Not only does he take his time with the shots, he did a lot of work outside the shoot to make sure the photos were great...and they were. Awesome guy - great photographer.<div class="rev-writer">... Ross B.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun was great to work with. He photographed a Quinceanera for us. Can't believe we got such great quality for such a low price! He was on time, prompted us to pose in really creative and beautiful ways. Our family was pleased. Photos were delivered as promised via a website. Trust his services for your next event.<div class="rev-writer">... Tiffany S.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun was a pleasure to work with. Incredibly responsive and the end result was absolutely stunning images. Well-edited and beautiful photography. I would highly recommend his services. He met my fiance and I at the location and was able to take some perfect stealth shots during our proposal. Could not be more pleased with the end result.<div class="rev-writer">... Andrew W.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun is a GREAT photographer and, to put the icing on the wedding cake so to speak, a GREAT person!! My daughter found him on Yelp;  I am so glad she did! We now have the most wonderful, beautiful photos and memory images of her wedding. ...And the results? Fantastic!!!!  The photos were ready even earlier than promised. After hearing nightmare stories from friends about wedding  photographers who took up to a year to get the proofs to the wedding couple, this was yet another plus. THANK YOU, TROJAN SHOOTER PHOTOGRAPHY!!<div class="rev-writer">... Rebecca M.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun photographed our daughter's bat mitzvah and did an excellent job.  He was prompt, professional, courteous and very friendly.  He was easy to work with, and he sent us our photos within two weeks.  Also, his rates were very reasonable.  We would totally hire him again!<div class="rev-writer">... Fern W.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">We did our anniversary shoot with Varun. He was very flexible. The weather was not good on the day of our photoshoot so we asked him to postponed it for the other week. He agreed. And one the photoshoot day, he was on time. He is very professional. We got very beautiful pictures. He gave all the pictures on the day before our anniversary which was after 10 days of the photoshoot. He made our anniversary even more special with the beautiful pictures. I am glad I chose him. I am definitely looking forward to work with him again.<div class="rev-writer">... Himanshu H.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun was our photographer for our daughters Bat Mitzvah and he did the most amazing job.  He took every shot when he had opportunity..had great ideas...showed up on time and stayed for the whole event and took direction for specific shots.  Ive worked with many photographers but he is really good.  The quality of his shots are so impressive.  I would refer him to anybody looking for a top rate photographer.  Cant wait to use him again!<div class="rev-writer">... G M.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun photographed our wedding and the pictures turned out amazing!  We loved them.  We are both pretty camera shy and he was great at making us feel at ease.  The venue was in a backyard and the day was really windy but he was able to capture the day perfectly. He is a pleasure to work with and we would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for a photographer.<div class="rev-writer">... Amber R.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun was our wedding photographer , we had been searching different websites and finally came across Varun, what caught my eye was that Varun had done same sex weddings and as a gay man that was pretty neat. equality for all right. Varun was so honest from the start , he gives you the different kinds of options he has and not just that but he does not make you feel forced to hire him, he's very respectful and just over all very responsible. to be completely honest that i was there late and he had been already taken pictures of family , the bungalow where the ceremony took place and all. Varun was so talented and so on point, i felt that he was just on point with catching every special moment of ours. from the ceremony to the cocktail hour to the reception as well. he's the one to go to, he has great contact and people skill , he makes time for you and really listens to what and how you want your day to come . he's def worth every penny we spent and then some. overall if you want someone that responsible, good listener and will take and deliver awesome professional pics he's your guy to go to.<div class="rev-writer">...

            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">I really can't say enough good things about Varun. I honestly was surprised to find a good photographer for a great price in the ultra-expensive Bay Area; that said, I feel beyond blessed and amazed what I really got was a fantastic, polite, poised, and talented photographer for my wedding and all of my major events for the future. I highly recommend that you let Varun be your photographer, too. I was nervous that my fiance (now husband) wouldn't like him, but I was way wrong - and my fiance is very picky with who he works with and spends time around. Varun helped us take amazing photos throughout SF City Hall, single-handedly lugged our stuff around as we moved through the building, and did it all patiently and with a smile. And the PHOTOS! I can't tell you enough how happy I am that I found someone who could truly capture how in love my husband and I are, even through the stress of the day. I would choose Varun again, and intend to hire him again for some classy pregnancy photos and/or new baby photos too. You should get him as your photographer - it'll be one of the best things you do for your wedding day, I promise!<div class="rev-writer">... Ariana B.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">We hired Varun as the photographer of our wedding in Feb. 2012. I'm not one that enjoys posing for photos and Varun's style worked very well for our event. He was on-time, well prepared and pretty much unseen during the event. When we returned from our honeymoon he had nearly 300 pictures uploaded for us online. We just finished looking through those photos last weekend and were amazed at how many excellent shots he took. I have no idea how he managed to get my reaction at the alter when my bride walked in and also pictures of the bride walking in. It's like he was at two places at one time. He took so much excellent, candid, photos that really give us a real feeling for the day. I can not give Varun enough praise and will continue to work with him in the future.<div class="rev-writer">... David P.</div></div>
            <div class="rev-text rev-margin">Varun took photographs at my son's birthday party. He did a great job and was very obliging when I asked him to make some extra collages and B/W's for me. Also, he worked very fast and shared  the pictures via G drive within a week of the party. I highly recommend him.<div class="rev-writer">... Arathi H.</div></div>
